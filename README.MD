# Funny nick name generetor

Welcome to the Random Nickname Generator!
This is a fun Python program that takes a user's first and last name and assigns them a random (and slightly mean 😈) nickname.

The final output is displayed in the following format:

```
FirstName (nickname) LastName
```

## Features

Prompts the user for a first name and last name

Validates input to ensure names contain letters

Randomly selects a nickname from a predefined list

Displays the final nickname result in a fun format

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program greets the user and explains what it does.

The user enters their first name.

The program checks that the input contains at least one letter.

The user enters their last name.

The same validation is applied.

A nickname is randomly chosen from a list.

The final nickname is printed to the screen.
